Build it. Test it. Debug it. And give me the final result

Cannu include everything in a zip file? Juat ans no need to include till we done everything.  I will tell u to include everything on a zip file. And btw did u cked the auto updater that will upgrade its db and power by reading public reports? And don't forget we must need to think and work like a godly black hat hacker. Cz yk only evil guys will attack sys. 

And also lets add a exploit feature too, like after it hunt and found critical exploitable bug and write on report, it will ask me do i wanna exploit them or not, if y then it will try to exploit it, like getting a reverse shell. Then i will conferm that it is really critical. And if it can't exploit fully it will decrease the bug's rating. And yk what to do.

And also i found another tool like this but its gui and mine will be cli, The tool featured in the video is called PenLegend. It is an AI-powered security research tool designed to find vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection automatically [00:31].
​According to the video, you can find the link to the tool in the description box or the pinned comment of the video [06:11]. At the time of the video, it was available for Kali Linux and Mac (ARM64), with a Windows version planned for the future [06:21].

Maybe u can learn from that and upgrade mine more.
 Don't forget to test then give me the full corrected code.


1. How much space and ram it will use? Did u optimized it?
2. Can it auto upgrade its task everytime after reading publicly availabpe reports?
3. If needed like need to use tools like burp or etc it can use those on usr's sys. If only cli then use a method for this kinda thing.
4. Can it freely hunt bugs with no restrictions?
5. Did u included exploit feature?
6. Report making?
7. Find more feature, go deep dive and add more features to take this to next 

Kk now make everything prepared. After that i will ck it then if all right then i will tell u to make zip
Did u done everything? Ck the full conv, make a todo list everything then verify. And also do u have any more cool features/ways to take this to godly level?

And find more cool features to make this thing godly level.

level. Spend ur full energy to find and include those things now. Plan more. Find more. Work more. Just 1 task. Find. Then i will command u to include.

It will ask the usr things like report save formate and more! Now go more full deep dive research, dive in black hole and bring as much godly features as u can. Just plan now. No include. Just use ur full energy for finding those things. Also while installation add a option for termux. Cz yk usr can't run rooted things on unrooted-termux. So while installation it will ask usr if its for termux(proot-distro included) or linux(have root access). Yk how to operate in termux, optimize, not all features will work so no need to install those. Then lastly rooted can use full power of sys. Now start ur journey to the black hole



Now ck the full conv. Make a todo if needed. List and add all the features in this conv as we talked. Then re ck everything. And confirm if everything is included. If not then include then re ck till everything included.


And find some more features lastly. Then include everything.  Don't left anything. Include everything now.
